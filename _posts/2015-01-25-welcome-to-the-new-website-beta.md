Welcome to the beta of the new <span class="drifts-logo">Drifts</span> website! We're glad to have you here. Just a few things to note at first:

* Some episodes are still in the process of being added. If you're looking for a particular episode (beginning at episode 14), you can use **http://cdn.drifts.fm/podcasts/driftsXXpodcast.mp3** for the meantime.
* The website is still thoroughly under construction. Things will change, move around, and may even look super buggy at times. But at least the colors are pretty!

If you have any feedback, feel free to email it over to [driftsradio@gmail.com](mailto:driftsradio@gmail.com?title=About%20the%20new%20website) and there'll be a response before you know it. Thanks for being such a fan of Drifts!!
