We're looking to launch a Patreon and we need YOUR help! Head over to [our Patreon page](http://patreon.com/driftsfm) and let us know what you think of our goals. (I think they're pretty reasonable.) And if you can, pledge! Here's to a very successful Spring!

I also just really wanted to have a second paragraph on this post to test out some front page stuff. No biggie.
