And with Until the Sun is Gone #3, the Summer of 2013 officially concludes. Two weeks ago, Mirror Kisses joined me in presenting a night full of great music and great fun. Before I go any further, I have a question for you.

Do you like dad rock?

If you do, you’ll love Mirror Kisses’ guest mix. It’s a nice cutout of what he’s been listening to and what’s been inspiring him while he works on new material, some of which you’ll be able to hear behind his voiceovers!

For the rest of the show, we’ve got a really great set of tunes here. Tracks from Holocron, Choongum, James Deen, Henrik José, Comanche, Fortune Howl, Shigeto, and a lot, lot more. Take a listen:
