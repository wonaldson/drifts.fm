This week, we’re just gonna relax for a bit. There’s no big emotional sweeps, no story, just some music you can lie down on the bed and snooze to. I felt like this was exactly what I needed after last week’s show. Su na joins us too, and he’s got a great little guest mix that fits in kind of nicely, with a few things from the vaporwave crowd and a few things from some of the more west-coasty beat scene crowd. Plus, he’s got a new one of his, from a new EP that’s out today on Flow-Fi which you have to check out.

Myself, I’ve got some new tunes from Selva Oscura, Groundislava, Slugabed, and Arms and Sleepers, and some more recent and older things from Flamingosis, Teeth, Pilotpriest, Nmesh and a lot more! Take a listen above, or find the tracklist below:
