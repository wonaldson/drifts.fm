Oh, my dog. This week, we dispose with the pop and focus on grooves. There’s a lot more four-to-the-floor in this one than you might be used to, but don’t worry - just get on your dancing pants, we’ll wait. Touurs joins me on guest duties, and he’s got a hyperactive little mix for us that flits from song to song like it’s nothin’ - he’s got tunes from Ta-ku, Cosmo’s Midnight, Hermitude, and his and Albert Ryan’s new project Good Nature. Protip: you’ll need those dancing pants. Myself, I come in peace with some new ones from Efdemin, Archie Pelago & Grenier, Plaid, and Fallgrapp, and some old ones from Octo Octa, Fatima Al Qadiri, DataLife, and a whole lot more.
