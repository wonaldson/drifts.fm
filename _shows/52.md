Well, hey! Time to update the podcast again, and there’s nothing better to kick off an update spree than a big collaboration with a big label. On this week’s show, DINOSAURUS REX takes the helm for a show showcasing his label, KEATS//COLLECTIVE. The majority of this show was spent premiering the fourth volume of the KEATS//COLLECTIVE compilation, with tons of juicy tracks spanning the first hour or so of the show. And label mainstay KEV//BOT joins us as guest - we interview him and he premieres a bunch of tracks he’s been working on. (A bunch of these have just come out on his new EP, Winter Heat!)

Throughout this dang thing we’ve got tracks from Showdee, A Sol Mechanic, VentureX, PIER.POINT, CROWNS, Wasted Nights, Flandy, BOX OF WOLVES, and a ton more. Peep a listen:
