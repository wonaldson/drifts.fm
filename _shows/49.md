This week, we’ve got a bit of a different show for you, in a number of ways. You may notice that this isn’t quite your usual episode of Drifts - I hope you can pick up on exactly how that is. It’s subtle, but it’s there enough to affect you. Regardless, I hope you enjoy it!

In this episode, m∞n, co-founder of Cadence Collective, joined me on the show. We talk about growing up, feeling pressured, and learning to create. In his guest mix, he brings us some old-school funk - along with a brand new track of his. You’d do well to listen carefully!

Alongside that, we’ve got the world premiere of a brand new tune from Hearts Bonfire called Carnival! We’ve also got new music from MACROSS 82-99 (being the first single off of the upcoming fourth volume of the KEATS//COLLECTIVE compilation), ambinate, Touurs, The Meets, Floex, Bewilderbeast, Infinity Shred and much, much more.
