Hi, everyone! Hope you’re all doing well. Tonight we return to our usual format for just a week - a nice break for our usual mix of tunes between last week’s dance show and next week’s experimental show. We’ve also got a whole bunch of brand new, pristine 2012 music for your ears!

Tonight’s fact: Two Rings is the only song I’ve ever played on more than one Drifts show. Just goes to show, Two Rings is two good.
