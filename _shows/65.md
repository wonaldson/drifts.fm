Our friends are always there for us, and that will never be more obvious than it was tonight. For the last show of the season, I gathered together four good friends and had them do some guest mixes to help us celebrate in style! First, Australian singer/songwriter/producer Cherax Destructor starts us off with a mix full of good ol’ pop stuff. Next off, Jheri Evans, under his 1-800-666-DRIP moniker, brings up the volume with a mix full of juke, trap, R&B, and even some of that cool PC Music stuff.  DJ Mythos of Mythic Beat calms things down with a set of some finely chilled downtempo grooves. Finally, Bunny from Supersymmetries (and co-owner of label Aural Sects) weaves a tale of two music empires in a very chaotic, very powerful mix that’s half music, half radio drama. None of these are to be missed. Grab a listen above, or find a download below:
