We're coming back to the airwaves soon, but first… we have a little unfinished business to deal with. This was only supposed to come out, what, seven months ago? On this show, Topaz Gang joined us for an interview to talk about their new album and graced us with a killer guest mix. But the show never aired in full, as my old computer died mysteriously halfway through airing the thing, making this episode one hell of a ghost story that you won't want to miss.
