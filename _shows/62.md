This week, something’s a little bit weird. But I can’t exactly put my finger on what. Does my voice sound a little bit funny? Maybe it’s just these songs - they’re unusual in the best of ways, as the best ones tend to be. Speaking of “the best”, the artist of one of my favorite albums of last year (and one of my favorites of this year so far as well) is joining us - Bewilderbeast brings us a wonderful guest mix that stops just about everywhere from Sun City Girls to Blondes to Charles Manson. He makes it work, too! Dude’s got chops.

And me? Well, I’ve got Bewilderbeast’s new single, Anyway - wouldn’t be a show with Bewilderbeast without his new single, would it? I’ve also got new stuff from Alfred English, TOKiMONSTA, and Dark Sky, as well as more great stuff from Taylor McFerrin, Fallgrapp, LLLL, Ramona Lisa and a ton more.
