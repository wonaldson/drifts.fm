It’s time again for our every-so-often really poppy episode! This week, I’m dragging you down the pipe into a field full of catchy hooks and melodies so round you’ll bounce right off. Loose Link, who’s coming out with a new EP on AMdiscs soon called Adda Allures, is joining us on guest mix duties – expect a crazy, mind-melting guest mix that, yet again, flits from track to track like it’s no big deal.

And I’ve got some great music for you too – new stuff from Spazzkid, Bewilderbeast, Photay, and Sloslylove, and older stuff from Baths, Different Sleep, Lone, Cherax Destructor, Young Yeller and a whole lot more. Take a listen above, or find the tracklist below:
