Drifts is a weekly electronic music radio show and podcast. Every week, we delve into the stranger side of electronic pop and dance music – the stuff that makes your ears tingle, your mind wander, and your heart race.

Drifts started back in September 2010 at WHRW-FM, Binghamton University’s campus radio station. I left Binghamton in April 2011, and since then, Drifts has grown into an internet radio show and podcast.

The show returned to FM airwaves on WFNP, out of New Paltz, NY, on February 1st, 2013. As of the end of 2013, it’s returned to the Internet at large.
